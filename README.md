# SPOTIFY-MUSIC-STREAM-ANALYSIS-FOR-THE-YEAR-2023
This analysis gives detailed insight and recommendations aimed to improve the music streaming platform services and increase profits.


INSIGHTS:

• January saw the highest streaming count, with 97 billion streams, indicating a peak in listener engagement at the beginning of the year.
May also had a high number of streams (53 billion), but there was a general decline in streams from June to August, with the lowest count in April (27 billion).
November and December experienced a slight resurgence, reaching 44 billion and 28 billion streams, respectively.



• “Blinding Lights” was the top streamed track, with a total of 3.7 billion streams, followed by “Shape of You” with 3.6 billion streams. These songs are likely evergreen tracks with lasting appeal.



• The Weeknd, Ed Sheeran, and Taylor Swift each received 14 billion streams, showing a close competition among top artists in terms of streaming volume.
Harry Styles and Bad Bunny also had high stream counts, with 12 billion and 10 billion streams, respectively.



RECOMMENDATIONS:

• Given the spike in streams in January and May, Spotify could consider launching promotional campaigns during these months to capitalize on increased user engagement.
They could also investigate why streams dip in mid-year (June to August) consistently and consider summer-themed playlists or exclusive releases to boost engagement.



• Songs like “Blinding Lights” and “Shape of You” continue to perform well. Spotify might consider creating playlists for “All-Time Hits” or “Evergreen Favorites” to engage long-time users and highlight tracks with enduring popularity.



• While major artists dominate the charts, Spotify could introduce emerging or trending artists to provide variety and encourage discovery, possibly through curated playlists or “Artist of the Month” features.
